      <p>Plastic View is an informal settlement located in Pretoria East. The area is full of shacks mostly
      made from plastic roofing, hence the name's origin. Many of the residents are foreign nationals,
      with some being undocumented, who survive on doing the odd jobs that many would shun e.g.
      gardening, cleaning, laundry and household repairs to name a few. These little jobs sustain
      families they stay with and those back in their home countries.</p>

      <p>The recent covid19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the residents of plastic view as

      outbreak decimated the few belongings that they had. These are people who do not have much,
      and barely survive from hand to mouth, and thus would require and appreciate any help to make
      their lives more bearable.

            <h3>What is Covid-19?</h3>
          </div>
          To understand a bit better why this website was formed its important to know what the Corona virus is (formally known as Covid-19).
          The corona virus is a virus that affects the respiratory system in living organisms such as humans and animals.
          The virus can cause illnesses that range from a minor flu to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS).The Cornoa Virus emerged Mid November of 2019 and was first spotted in Wuhan,China. Numbers started rising and by March 2020, this virus started a world-wide pandemic.
          <br>
          <br>
          The virus got to South Africa in March and this has made a huge impact in our country. From people losing jobs, people dying and has also
          made an emotional and psychological impact on the people of South Africa. As citizens of South Africa we have started this initiative to
          try and help a few families that have been affected by this pandemic in our society.
