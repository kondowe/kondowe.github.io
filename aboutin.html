<p>This amazing family of 3 (a wife,husband and 1 child) has been heavily affected by the corona virus just as much as anyone else. However due to the circumstances the family already had, the virus made a huge impact. The two amazing breadwinners of the family do all they can for their family

broke out. The family have been struggling with finding work as the current economic climate has
been shaky. The family of 4 have been faced with terrible circumstances. However this does not
stop them from doing what they enjoy doing. They also try to help out other people even though
they are in a difficult situation as their hearts are filled with nothing but love and joy when they
know they've done a good deed</p>

pitch in when they can by selling items when they can after they get back from school due to
health restrictions in the country this has been difficult for them to find money and as such they
have had to make more sacrifices for them to survive these disheartening times.
